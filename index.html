      <h1>"Death is nothing to us."</h1>
      <p>
        "Take the habit of thinking that death is nothing for us. For all good
        and evil lie in sensation: but death is deprivation of any sensitivity.
        Therefore, knowledge of the truth that death is nothing to us, enables
        us to enjoy this mortal life, not by adding the prospect of infinite
        duration, but by taking away the desire of the immortality. For there is
        nothing left to fear in life, who really understood that out of life
        there is nothing terrible. So pronounced empty words when it is argued
        that death is feared, not because it is painful being made, but because
        of the wait is painful. It would indeed be a futile and pointless fear
        than would be produced by the expectation of something that does not
        cause any trouble with his presence.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        And that of all the evils that gives us more horror, death is nothing to
        us, since we exist as ourselves, death is not, and when death exists, we
        are not. So death is neither the living nor the dead, since it has
        nothing to do with the former and the latter are not.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        But the multitude sometimes flees death as the worst of evils, sometimes
        called as the term of the ills of life. The wise, however, does not
        ignore life and did not afraid of no longer living, for life he is not
        dependent, and it does not consider that there the lesser evil not to
        live."

        "The mind is but one part of the human being, which occupies a definite
        location, just like the ears and the eyes and the other senses that
        guide our life; and since the hands or eyes or nose cannot feel or
        function when they are separated from us, but soon putrefy and rot, so
        the soul cannot exist without the body, or without the whole human
        being…

        Consider the time before we were born: we felt no distress when the
        Carthaginians were attacking Rome on every side; and the whole world was
        shaken by the frightening tumult of that war… and in the same way in the
        future, when we shall no longer exist, and the final breaking up occurs
        for the body and spirit from which we are now compounded into a single
        unit, nothing whatever will be able to happen to us, or produce any
        sensation — not even if the the earth should collapse in to the sea, or
        the sea explode in the sky…"

        "…Like rivers whose constitutive substance (water) is always changing,
        persons constantly gain and lose attributes. And attributes are easily
        shared, readily copied from one individual to another. When you learn
        something from another person, you absorb part of himself. He is a
        collection of attributes, just as a book (the intellectual work, not the
        bound volume made of paper) is a sequence of sentences.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        To learn from another person is like incorporating a quotation from
        someone else’s book into one’s own composition. In learning from him, we
        take on part of what he is. The fact that attributes (or information, if
        you prefer) flow so freely between persons, makes the word “open”
        appropriate. We are open vessels, not closed ones…"
